        <p>A sweeter take on the Italian classic. It has all the ingredients of a regular spaghetti dish, but with banana ketchup for sweetness. You can also add hot dogs into it as well for additional meat.
            The banana ketchup is delicious and tones down some of the acidity and sourness found in traditional spaghetti.
